# Political and Economic Baselines

## Overview

This repository contains a systems-theory framework for analyzing political and economic governance through the concept of **baselines**.

A baseline is not a historical ideal, ideological position, or partisan preference.  
It is a **recoverable reference state** that allows complex systems to detect error, reverse failed interventions, and prevent runaway optimization.

The central claim of this work is:

> Systems that cannot return to baseline cannot reliably distinguish learning from drift.

This framework is designed to be **non-partisan, non-moral, and non-historical**, focusing instead on structural properties such as reversibility, legibility, and survivability.

## Core Concepts

### Baseline (Systems Definition)

A baseline is a reference state that:
- Enables error detection
- Allows rollback without crisis
- Preserves participant agency
- Maintains direct feedback between decisions and consequences

Baselines are necessary for system resilience. Their erosion leads to fragility, coercion, and narrative substitution for correction.

## Political Baseline

**Definition**  
Political baseline is defined as **direct legibility between decision-makers and lived consequences**.

A political system maintains baseline when:
- Decision-makers live materially inside the system they regulate
- Policies are reversible within a single election cycle
- Power is revocable without crisis
- Governance errors are admitted rather than rebranded
- Citizens can exit systems without punishment

**Return-to-Baseline Test**

> *If this policy fails, can it be reversed within one election cycle without social rupture?*

Failure of this test indicates baseline violation.

## Economic Baseline

**Definition**  
Economic baseline is defined as **human survivability without leverage dependence**.

An economic system maintains baseline when:
- Individuals can survive without permanent debt
- Productive work is decoupled from speculative finance
- Failure does not permanently exile participants
- Small-scale economic units can exist without scale capture

**Return-to-Baseline Test**

> *Can the average worker reset their economic life after failure without institutional permission?*

Failure of this test indicates coercive drift.

## What This Framework Is Not

- Not a political platform
- Not a policy prescription
- Not a historical argument
- Not a call for regression
- Not an ideological critique

This work is diagnostic, not prescriptive.

---

## Intended Use

This framework may be used to:
- Evaluate policy proposals for reversibility
- Detect systemic drift before crisis
- Compare governance structures across regions
- Design resilient institutions
- Analyze economic survivability independent of growth metrics

---

## Structure

- `/paper` — Core paper text and revisions  
- `/notes` — Supporting analysis, diagrams, and extensions  
- `/examples` — Applied baseline tests (optional / evolving)  

---

## Status

This repository is an **open, evolving framework**.  
Critique, falsification, and refinement are explicitly encouraged.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions should:
- Focus on structure, not ideology
- Preserve reversibility and testability
- Avoid moral framing
- Maintain systems-level reasoning

Pull requests that increase clarity, falsifiability, or applicability are welcome.
